I've been working on process of a really big String replace on the Java recently.
That simnply, When input text on my code. Regular expression working at least 1000 times.
Namely, makes String heap memory value of that many datas.
Sometimes, This situation get strains on the system. Because the text string is a little large.
And at least 1000 similar text data are generated on memory.
