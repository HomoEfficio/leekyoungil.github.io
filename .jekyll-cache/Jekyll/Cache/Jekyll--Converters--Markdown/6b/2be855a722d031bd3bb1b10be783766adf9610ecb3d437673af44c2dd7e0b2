I"l<p>Sometimes, we have to limit the application request, it’s called the TPS throttling.</p>

<p>If we use the application with the spring boot, we can’t throttle the TPS.<br />
However, if we use the Nginx which is located in front of the spring boot application and is named the reverse proxy, the Nginx can throttle the TPS.</p>

<p>There is a module of the limit_req_zone on the Nginx, generally, it is used to protect a web server from the DDOS.</p>

<p>I tried to apply the module for regulating the TPS.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this configuration.</p>

<pre><code class="language-editorconfig">limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=my_zone:10m rate=30r/s;
</code></pre>

<p>This configuration is meaning of making a limit zone, it’s name of my_zone, and client ip address used for key, and the keys are saving to maximum 10M of memory.</p>

<p>And when request of clients are more than 30 times per second, it is blocked.</p>

<p>Let’s apply the zone to our configuration.</p>

<pre><code class="language-editorconfig">server {
  location / {
    limit_req zone=my_zone burst=10 nodelay;
    proxy_pass http://spring-boot-application;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this way, it can use the my_zone configuration to apply spring-boot-application.</p>

<p>There is one more thing, you should also check the Burst keyword.<br /> 
It means making 10 queues, when server is over limit of client request.</p>

<p>But, this configuration is not the result I want.</p>

<p>What’s the problem?</p>

<p>Let’s look it again.</p>

<pre><code class="language-editorconfig">limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=my_zone:10m rate=30r/s;
</code></pre>

<p>This $binary_remote_addr is built-in variable of the Nginx, it has client ip address.</p>

<p>So, change the code to the $request_uri which is also built-in variable of the Nginx, changed code has the URI of client request.</p>

<p>So, we can throttle client request per the URI.</p>

<p>If the same URI requested is over limit, the Nginx will be return to client the 503 http status.</p>

<p>If the other Nginx is placed in front of the Proxy-Nginx, the Proxy-Nginx is to return the 503 status.<br />
At this time, the request of client redirect to the another Proxy_Nginx by the front Nginx.</p>

<p>And finally, I will explain overall by using system configuration map.</p>
